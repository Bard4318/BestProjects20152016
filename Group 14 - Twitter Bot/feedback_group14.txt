1. Your ability to program with Matlab

    - This project creates a Twitter bot that automatically follows other users, retweets other users' tweets, post tweets from a list of preset messages, runs indefinitely, and does not give away the account's nature. 
	- This is an impressive piece of work, that uses external libraries, and involves an understanding of the Twitter API, a great mastering of MATLAB coding, and definitely more than I could possibly expect from students that never heard of MATLAB a few months before.  
	- This is high-level code, which must be used by an expert. If you want to distribute it, you may want to add a few user-friendly features to it, like an interface that lets the user select keywords, etc. 
	- The code is well commented and easy to read. Great job. 
	

2. How well you present your results

    - instructions on how to USE the code are very precise, with details on how to setup your credentials on the Twitter developers' website, what libraries are used, etc. Just a little thing: you should have stated WHICH file must be run. Nevermind. I guess the name FINALCODE.m gave away which one I had to run...
	- The report is clear. You explain the difficulties encountered during the development. 

3. How creative you have been in realizing your project

    - It's a creative idea, and a great implementation.
